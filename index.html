	<h1>Passive Housing</h1>

	<main>
	<h2>So... What is it?</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Definition</h3>
			<p>
				Passive housing is designed to reduce heat transfer,
				in order to reduce energy consumption from heating/cooling.
				That's where "passive," comes in;
				it regulates temperature through passive means,
				rather than traditional air conditioning or heating.
				Passive building design can go beyond "housing,"
				design principles can be used for commercial or public structures as well.
			</p>

			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Location - passive housing can be built in any location, but climate does matter</li>
				<li>
					Taking advantage of the environment
					<ul>
						<li>Sun - prefer south-facing windows in cooler areas</li>
						<li>Tree shading - plant trees for shade in hotter areas</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Insulation - reduces thermal bridging (prevents overheating in summer and loss of heat in winter)</li>
				<li>Windows/Doors - preserve air quality and reduce heat transfer</li>
				<li>Ventilation - preserve air quality and controls moisture</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Lower energy costs for residents</li>
				<li>Increased indoor air quality (Ventilation, less mold)</li>
				<li>Resilience in power outages</li>
				<li>Reduced maintenance footprints for the developers</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Quick History</h3>
			<p>Passive house is a fairly new design paradigm.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First passive houses: Germany, 1990s (Dr. Wolfgang Feist)</li>
				<li>At the beginning, mostly single-family homes (easier to prototype)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

	<h2>Considerations in the General Housing Design Process</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Refurbishing</h3>
			<p>
				It is possible to remodel or renovate a traditional home to have passive features.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Integration with Other Technology</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Solar energy</li>
				<li>3D printed concrete buildings</li>
				<li>Green roofs</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Density</h3>
			<p>
				Passive housing principles can be integrated into high-rise apartment complexes.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="idea_block">
			<h3>Housing Costs and Property Value</h3>
			<p>
				A passive house costs about 5-10% more to build than a traditional home.
			</p>
			<p>
				Resale value is also expected to be higher than for traditional homes.
				But, context matters!
			</p>

	</div>

	<h2>PHIUS</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="idea_block">
			<p>
				Phius = Passive House Institute, US
			</p>
			<p>
				They set standards and certifications,
				including those for retrofited and commercial buildings.
			</p>
			<h3>PHIUS ZERO</h3>
			<p>
				Zero energy standard for newly constructed housing.
				Sets the net source energy target at ZERO,
				does not allow for fossil-fueled combustion on site,
				and provides both on-site and off-site renewable energy options to get to ZERO.
			</p>
