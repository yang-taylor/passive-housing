		<h2>So... What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			Passive housing is designed to reduce heat transfer,
			in order to reduce energy consumption from heating/cooling.
			That's where "passive," comes in;
			it regulates temperature through passive means,
			rather than traditional air conditioning or heating.
			Passive building design can go beyond "housing,"
			design principles can be used for commercial or public structures as well.

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Location</li>
			<li>
				Taking advantage of the environment
				<ul>
					<li>Sun</li>
					<li>Tree Shading</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Insulation</li>
			<li>Windows/Doors</li>
			<li>Ventilation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Benefits</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Lower energy costs for residents</li>
			<li>Increased indoor air quality (Ventilation, less mold)</li>
			<li>Resilience in power outages</li>
			<li>Reduced maintenance footprints for the developers</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Quick History</h2>
		<p>Passive house is a fairly new design paradigm.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First passive houses: Germany, 1990s</li>
			<li>At the beginning, mostly single-family homes (easier to prototype)</li>
		</ul>
